### HackerRank: Save The Princess Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to the Bot Saves Princess 1 &amp; 2 on HackerRank.com, using ruby 2.2.2p95.  

You can find the original challenges from HackerRank.com [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess) and [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess2). In my solutions I updated the input set up from HackerRank to automatically create the grid after answering the user prompts.

To run these programs, first clone down this repo:

`$ git clone git@github.com:MattRooney/hacker-rank.git`

Then navigate into the folder:

`$ cd hacker-rank/`

From there you can run the programs from the command line:

`$ ruby save_the_princess.rb` &amp; `$ ruby save_the_princess_2.rb`
